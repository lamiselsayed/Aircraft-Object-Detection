About the Project
* This project utilizes the RarePlanes dataset available on Cosmiq Works (https://www.cosmiqworks.org/RarePlanes/), which contains real and synthetic images of the overhead view of aircrafts from a satellite. The dataset aims to improve the application of different computer vision tasks for aircraft imagery.
* For the scope of the computer vision project, the RarePlanes dataset will be used to investigate the efficacy of different object detection approaches, specifically using only the real images of aircraft.

Object Detection Approaches Used
* YOLOv8
* YOLOv9
* DETR
* RetinaNet

Running The Project
* To view the YOLOv8 model, go to the 'models' folder and run the '' notebook.
* To view the YOLOV9 model, go to the 'models' folder and run the 'YOLOv9 Object Detection.ipynb' notebook. Follow the instructions in the notebook and run each cell in the order they are presented in. This applies to the training, validation, and testing parts of the notebook.
* To view the DETR model, go to the 'models' folder and run the '' notebook.
* To view the RetinaNet model, go to the 'models' folder and run the 'RetinaNet.ipynb' notebook. Follow the instructions in the notebook and run each cell in the order they are presented in. This applies to the training, validation, and testing parts of the notebook.
